There are basically two categories of time in the ESP system. They can be classified as :
        1.      Interval Time   ->      Time via which intervals can be measured.
                                        This can be used to time events, or rather gap between events.
                                        Basic timing delays fall into this category.

                                        Data Structure to handle interval time:
                                        ---------------------------------------
                                        struct timeval tv;      //This struct type stores the amount of time elapsed
                                                                //since system REBOOT in sec as well as usec form
                                        gettimeofday(&tv);      //gettimeofday() populates the struct timeval

                                        Using FREERTOS TICKS to determine interval:
                                        --------------------------------------------
                                        uint32_t tick_counter=xTaskGetTickCount(); //no. of ticks since REBOOT
                                        /*TICK is a const accessed by portTICK_PERIOD_MS = 1msec*/
